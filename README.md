# Random-number-generator-web-app
DevProjects project

Introduction
There are various use cases for a Random Number Generator. You could do a random dice roll or get a random quote. Most of the time, the implementation is relatively straightforward and similar to this projectâ€™s approach. In this project, we will create a dice roll simulation.

Requirements
The RNG should consist of:

An input box to assign how many dice to roll
A drop down box to select the sides of the dice (for example d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20)
A PHP rand(); function taking the inputs from the form
An output to show # of dice rolled, the type of dice (d4, d6 ..), the total count of the dices rolled
Output the details (number) of the individual dice rolls (Possibly using a foreach loop)

Implementation: 
HTML/CSS for the form, Javascript Promise for increment number counter animation, PHP for generating random dice result.
